# Theorical Challenge

## Processes, Threads and Coroutines

- _One case where you would use processes to solve a problem and why_

    - Processes have some advantages and disadvantages compared with threads according to the resources and how those resources are managed. The kind of problems I would solve with processes are independent tasks that ensure if one process fail doesn't affect any other processes. For example scraping programs that fetch data from different competitors web page, if one program fails it doesn't interferes with the fetching task of the other program.

- _One case where you would use threads to solve a problem and why_


- _One case where you would use coroutines to solve a problem and why_


## Optimization of operating system resources

- _If you have 1.000.000 of elements and you have to check information for each of them in an API HTTP. Â¿How you would do it? Explain_
