# Mercado Libre Scraper

This is a scraper software that retrieve data from the [Mercado Libre](https://listado.mercadolibre.com.ar/celular-smartphones#D[A:celular%20smartphones]) web page, searching by the words _celular smartphones_ and getting information of all the _Samgung_ items that have the **FULL** service.

The program is developed using _Scrapy Framework_ from Python because at the moment is one of the most powerful frameworks to crawl data from webpages using XPath language.

Since I have some experience using Python, this is my first scraper using _Scrapy_ as a scraper framework and in order to acomplish this I had to complete some courses in record time. One of the biggest challenges was to understang how to use all the tools scrappy give me to develop a very efficient and professional piece of code.
